# ROAST - Robust Asynchronous Schnorr Threshold Signatures

See [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf).

Would enable _extremely_ cheap threshold signature for Ethereum: one `ecrecover` call.

This is currently the best threshold signature scheme that can be applied to decentralized applications.

This threshold signature scheme is based on [FROST](./FROST.md), but is also robust asynchronous signature scheme.
